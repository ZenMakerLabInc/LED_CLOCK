# Zen Maker Lab Inc's LED Clock Project

The Led Clock Project Kit is a great interactive way to learn about electronics and coding while having fun!  Learn about the time, oscillation, pulses, colour, and time!  Develop some of your own coding skills.  Use it to time your activities whether you're outside or at a desk.

Design the functionality that you want and learn to program Arduino. 
Make your LED Clock using your kit components. 
Play your own music the way you want to for family and friends.

# Installation

0) Install the Arduino IDE (or add the extension if on a chrome book)
1) Dowload your code
2) Extract file here...
3) Add the FastLED Library.  a) Add it to your library folder; usually under \Documents\Arduino\libraries  b) If you are using chrome, go to create.arduino.cc, login, and import it to your libraries
4) Open the LED_CLOCK folder and find the .ino file.  That is your code!

# Configuration
When your code is ready to be uploaded, connect your arduino to your computer using a usb cable.
Under board, set it to arduino nano.  Under flavor or bootloader, select oldbootloader.
Under port, select the port your arduino is connected to (remove it and plug it in again to check)
When ready to upload, click the check mark and then the side arrow ->

# FAQ
Q: I have a chrome book and the arduino isn't registering.  What should I do?

A: There is an option if you have an ACER or ASUS chrome book.  You need to buy a subscription to the ardiuno cc extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arduino-create/dcgicpihgkmccjigalccipmjlnjopdfe  Its $1/month.  NOTE: I've had issues in the past with Samsung chromebooks so heads up!

Q: I have a subscription / downloaded the arduino IDE but it still won't work!  What now?

A: Try a different bootloader.  It might no longer be oldbootloader.  You can also try a different usb port.

Q: Why doesn't my LED Clock work when I upload the code?

A: You have to complete the activity in the code to get it to work.

Q: I didn't realize I needed hardware for this project.  Where can I buy it?

A: Check us out at shop.zenmakerlab.com.  You can find the project kit there.
